            <h4><a href="index.html">Main Menu</a></h4>
            
            <h2>What you will need</h2>
            

<h4>For the sauce:
1 (6oz) can tomato paste
3/4 cup water
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp dried basil
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp dried oregano
1/2 tsp salt
1 Tbsp grated parmesan cheese</h4>

<h4>In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except the cheese and stirring constantly, heat over medium heat until bubbly. Remove from heat and stir in cheese until melted. Set aside to cool before using. Will make TWO 16" pizzas.</h4> 

<h4>For the crust:
2 Tbsp sugar
3/4 cup warm water (around 100*F)
1 tsp active dry yeast
1 tsp salt
1 Tbsp olive oil
2 cups AP flour</h4>

<h4>In a stand mixer or a large bowl by hand, combine sugar and water. Sprinkle yeast over the top of the water and let bloom for about 10 minutes. Add in salt, olive oil and flour and mix to form a dough. Dough will be sticky! Knead by machine for about a minute or by hand for 2-3 using only minimal flour to prevent sticking. Put into an oiled bowl and toss to coat and cover with a damp towel. Put into a warm place to rise for about an hour or until double in size.</h4>

<h4>For the pizza:
1 recipe pizza crust
1/2 recipe pizza sauce
2 cups (8oz) mozzarella cheese
3 oz pepperoni
1 Tbsp cornmeal</h4>

<h4>Optional ingredients for additional or different toppings of your choice.</h4>

<h4>Preheat oven to 500*F. Using a 16" pizza pan, sprinkle or dust the pan lightly with the cornmeal to prevent sticking. Turn your dough out without punching down and starting in the center and using only your fingertips, press dough out to the edges of the pizza pan, leaving a slight lip around the outside. Spread half the pizza sauce on the top of the crust to about 3/4" of the edge. Top with cheese and then whatever topping you so choose. Bake for 7 minutes or until golden brown and toppings are cooked.</h4>
