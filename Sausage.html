            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h4>1/2 recipe homemade pizza dough (or you can use store-bought dough)</h4>
            <h4>1/2 cup marinara sauce</h4>
            <h4>1 and 1/2 cups cooked spicy sausage crumbled</h4>
            <h4>1/4 cup thinly sliced onion</h4>
            <h4>1/4 cup thinly sliced mini sweet peppers</h4>
            <h4>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</h4>
            <h4>1 tablespoon chili oil</h4>
            <h4>1 tablespoon crushed red pepper</h4>
            <h2>Directions</h2>
            <h4> Spray your pizza pan with non-stick spray and dust lightly with flour and gently transfer the dough to your prepared pizza pan.</h4>
            <h4>Adjust the rack to the lower middle of the oven and preheat to 475<div id="degree"></div>F.</h4>
            <h4>Spread the marinara sauce evenly over the crust leaving a 1-inch bare rim around the edge. Sprinkle the sausage, onion, and peppers over the sauce. Spread the mozzarella cheese evenly over the top.</h4>
            <h4>Bake for 15-17 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese has melted. Rotate halfway through the cooking time.</h4>
            <h4>Drizzle the chili oil over the top and sprinkle with red pepper. Let cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes before slicing.</h4>
